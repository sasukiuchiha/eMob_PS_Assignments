why memset work with zero and one?
 
For simplicity, 0 in 8 bits is just 00000000 and -1 is 11111111

so popularly, when we use them with 0 and -1 for say integers, the internal binary representation is finally either 0 or -1

However, we can put any value, and expect the final value say of an int. E.g. if you memset value 5 in 4 bytes int we expect it to be in its final 32 bit:

00000101 00000101 00000101 00000101

where 00000101 = 5

why startup code intialize global and static variables with zero?
-because that is the standard of the c

How can we swap 2 variables without using a template variable ?
â€¢ Follow-up :- Why is this true ?

by using ^ operator

why?
for example
i will swap between x,y 

x = x ^ y;
y = x ^ y;   //y=x^y^y   so y=x;
x = x ^ y;   //x=x^y^x   so x=y;
